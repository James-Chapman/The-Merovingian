// Publishes the `std::unique_lock` that currently owns `HomeserverRuntime::mutex`
// for this thread's in-flight request, so code deeper in the call stack can
// release that lock around a blocking network call without threading the lock
// object through every intervening signature.
//
// The publication is thread_local, so one request thread never observes
// another's guard. A thread that publishes nothing — the federation worker, a
// test calling a service function directly — leaves the publication null, and
// the default-constructed `RuntimeLockRelease` below then has no guard to
// release.
//
// Nesting is supported: the innermost scope wins and restores its predecessor
// on exit. That matches the one nesting path in the server, where the
// client-server dispatcher releases its own guard before delegating a media
// route to the local router, which then takes (and publishes) its own.

// Releases `HomeserverRuntime::mutex` for the lifetime of the scope and
// re-acquires it on exit, including when the guarded call throws.
//
// Holding `runtime.mutex` across outbound HTTP freezes the whole process:
// every client-server request and every inbound federation transaction
// contends on that one mutex, so one slow or unreachable peer stalls all of
// them for the full duration of the timeout — up to `remote_timeout_seconds`
// per destination. Wrap every blocking network call that can run beneath a
// request handler in one of these, and keep runtime state reads and mutations
// outside it.
//
// **It releases every recursion level this thread holds, not just one.**
// `runtime.mutex` is recursive and a self-locking service function called from
// a request handler holds it twice: once via the dispatcher's guard and once
// via its own. Dropping a single level leaves the mutex held for the whole
// blocking call — the defect shipped three times over
// (`create_room` 0.12.1, `leave_room` 0.12.3, `invite_user_by_threepid`
// 0.12.6), each time because the author released the guard they had in hand
// and not the one an outer frame held. Every level is restored on exit, in the
// same count, so outer frames resume owning exactly what they owned before.
//
// Two constructors, one behaviour:
//
//   RuntimeLockRelease{}        // find the mutex via the thread's published guard
//   RuntimeLockRelease{guard}   // find it via a guard in hand
//
// The argument says only which `unique_lock` to read the mutex address from,
// never whether that guard believes it owns it. The set of levels released is
// the same either way, so choosing the "wrong" one can no longer leave the
// mutex held.
//
// **A guard's `owns_lock()` is NOT cleared for the duration of the scope.**
// The levels being dropped belong to `unique_lock` objects in frames this
// scope cannot reach, so the release necessarily goes through the mutex and no
// guard's bookkeeping flag can be updated — the one passed in included. That
// is sound only because nothing outside `request_lock.cpp` reads the flag
// (`grep -rn owns_lock src include`) and the depth is restored exactly before
// any guard can act on it. Read `RuntimeMutex::held_by_current_thread()`
// instead if you need to know whether the mutex is held; a nested release
// scope does exactly that, and so correctly finds nothing left to release.
//
// Doing nothing is always a valid outcome: with no guard published and none
// passed, there is no mutex to act on and the scope neither unlocks nor
// re-locks.
