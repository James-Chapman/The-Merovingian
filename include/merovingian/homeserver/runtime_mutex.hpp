// The mutex guarding `HomeserverRuntime`, and the one lock every client-server
// request, every inbound federation transaction, and every background worker
// contends on.
//
// It is a recursive mutex because a request handler that already holds it may
// call a service function which takes it again — `create_room`, `join_room`,
// and `invite_user_by_threepid` all remain independently callable. Recursion is
// what makes releasing it around blocking work subtle: `unlock()` drops ONE
// level, so a handler that releases its own guard while an outer frame still
// holds one leaves the mutex locked for the whole of the network call it
// thought it had released it for. That defect has reached production three
// times (`create_room` in 0.12.1, `leave_room` in 0.12.3,
// `invite_user_by_threepid` in 0.12.6).
//
// `std::recursive_mutex` cannot report whether the calling thread still owns
// it, so this type records the owner and the recursion depth alongside it.
// `RuntimeLockRelease` (request_lock.hpp) uses `held_by_current_thread()` to
// drop *every* level the thread holds rather than only the one guard it was
// handed, which is what makes the release primitive impossible to misuse.
//
// Satisfies `Lockable`, so it works with `std::unique_lock`, `std::lock_guard`
// and `std::scoped_lock` exactly as `std::recursive_mutex` does.
