    // Two reasons it must work this way. First, the levels belong to
    // `unique_lock` objects in frames this scope cannot reach — a dispatcher's
    // guard, a self-locking caller's — and leaving one held keeps the mutex
    // locked for the whole of the blocking work this scope was opened for.
    // Second, releasing through one guard while draining the rest through the
    // mutex would leave that guard's `owns_lock()` flag and the real recursion
    // depth disagreeing in opposite directions across two objects; an inner
    // release scope that then trusted a flag would unlock a mutex this thread
    // no longer holds, underflow `depth_`, and strand the runtime mutex locked
    // for the life of the process.
    //
    // The consequence, and the reason this is safe: **every `unique_lock` on
    // this mutex keeps reporting `owns_lock() == true` for the lifetime of
    // this scope, including the one passed in.** Nothing outside this file
    // reads that flag (`grep -rn owns_lock src include`), the depth is
    // restored exactly before any of those guards can act on it, and an inner
    // release scope reads the mutex — see `held_by_current_thread` — so it
    // correctly finds nothing left to release.
